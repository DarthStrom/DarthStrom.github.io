This is the first post on my blog.  Please excuse my inexperienced writing style.  Hopefully you'll find something of interest to you.

The next post will likely be about the soft skill of pair programming, but I hope to have technical topics as well.

This blog uses Jekyll which offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight swift %}
func printHi(name: String) {
    print("Hi, \(name)")
}
printHi('Tom')
//=> prints 'Hi, Tom'
{% endhighlight %}
