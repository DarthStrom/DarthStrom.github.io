title: Design Principle Kata 3 - Liskov Substitution Principle
comments: true
---

Like [my last post]({% post_url 2016-07-03-ocp %}), this post introduces a code kata (coding exercise) that is designed to reinforce the Liskov Substitution Principle.

The idea behind the Liskov Substitution Principle is that subclasses should be able to be used wherever their parent class is used without having unexpected results.  For example, you might have a `Duck` class that has a `fly` method.  You might be tempted to subclass `Duck` to get a `RubberDuck`.  The `RubberDuck` class would get all of the functionality of the `Duck` class, but there's an issue.  Rubber ducks can not fly.

Software that uses `Duck` expects to be able to call `fly` but that does not make sense if a `RubberDuck` has been used.

One way to remedy situations like this is to favor composition over inheritance.  So, instead of making `RubberDuck` inherit from `Duck` we could make a `DuckAppearance` that both `Duck` and `RubberDuck` have and can use to get what they should look like.  Then we could have a `Flyable` class that just `Duck` has to handle flying behavior.  We might even be able to use `Flyable` on classes that have nothing to do with ducks, like `Airplane`.

You can find the code for the kata on [github](https://github.com/DarthStrom/game-of-life-refactoring-kata).
